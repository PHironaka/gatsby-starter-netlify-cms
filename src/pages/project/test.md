Then in your terminal run gatsby develop to start the Gatsby development server. Once the server is running, it will print the address to open for viewing. Its typically localhost:8000. Open that in a browser and you should see the text “Hello World” in the top left corner. Now navigate to /admin/ - so if your site is at localhost:8000, go to localhost:8000/admin/. The trailing slash is required!
